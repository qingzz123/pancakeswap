  "Since the rewards from lock-staking are only distributed at the end of the duration, the prize pool to be distributed in each of the 10 weeks upon deposit is borrowed from the CAKE treasury based on the estimated APY. The rewards at the end of the duration from the deposit will be used to repay the treasury and to distribute the 20% staking rewards. Because the APY may change over the duration based on other deposits and their lock-periods in the lock CAKE pool, there may be a small deviance from the above percentages specified (+/- 10%). But, ultimately all staking rewards net of the Pottery fees will be returned to depositors through prize pool or rewards -- the expected value is the same.": "由于锁定质押的奖励仅在持续时间结束时分配，在入金后的 10 周内分配的奖池是根据估计的 APY 从 CAKE 奖金库中借用的。入金持续时间结束时的奖励将用于偿还奖金库并分配 20% 的质押奖励。由于 APY 可能会根据其他入金及其在锁定 CAKE 池中的锁定期在持续时间内发生变化，可能与上述指定百分比存在细微偏差 (+/- 10%)。但是，最终扣除糖浆彩票费用后的所有质押奖励将通过奖池或奖励返还给入金者 – 预期价值相同。",
